# AR Proof of concept for a Tourism App

In this repo you can find the final source files for the AR project I made at EPFL in the summer of 2021.

### Want to see some of the final results?
Please see the demo on [youtube](https://youtu.be/Qo12dEF-1TI]). Please note that the result of the compass calculations became a lot more volatile after an update of the OS of the smartphone used for testing. To handle this problem the actual compass angle is now computed through the mean of the 3 latest signals. However this could not reduce the fluctuations entirely. To see what the graphical objects looked like with a more stable compass angle, please refer to this [demo](https://youtu.be/i56ZqEyWxyI) that was taken att an earlier stage of the app development and before the OS update.
