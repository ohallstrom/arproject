# arproject

These are the final source files for the AR project I made at EPFL in the summer of 2021.

The main concern of this project is the fluctuations in the compass and the inaccuracy of the GPS signals. With this in mind, please have a look at the following demo for this proof of concept.

Please see the demo on [youtube](https://youtu.be/Qo12dEF-1TI])

For a more detailed project description, please see the [report](https://github.com/ohallstrom/arproject/blob/master/Projet%20AR%20-%20Oskar%20Hallstr√∂m.pdf)
